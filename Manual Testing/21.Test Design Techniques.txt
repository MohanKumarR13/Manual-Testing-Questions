Test Design Techniques
----------------------
Test design techniques are methods used to create test cases that cover all possible scenarios and use cases of the 
software application being tested. Several test design techniques are available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
In this chapter, we will discuss some of the popular test design techniques. We will see some common techniques, 
such as equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, and some more obscure but quite useful in 
complex situations, such as pairwise testing and modified condition decision coverage.
