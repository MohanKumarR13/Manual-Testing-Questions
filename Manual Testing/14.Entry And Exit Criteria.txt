Entry And Exit Criteria
=======================
Entry Criteria : A set of conditions to be met/satisefied before an activity can begin

Exit Criteria : A set of conditions to be met/satisefied before an activity can be conclusion

Both these criterias are applicable for all the phases of STLC

Practically speaking,we can't follow the entry and exit criterias in a strict manner
