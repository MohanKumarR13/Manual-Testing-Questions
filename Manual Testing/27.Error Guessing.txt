Error Guessing Technique
The test case design technique or methods or approaches that need to be followed by every test engineer while writing the 
test cases to achieve the maximum test coverage. If we follow the test case design technique, 
then it became process-oriented rather than person-oriented.

The test case design technique ensures that all the possible values that are both positive and negative are required for the testing purposes. 

In software testing, we have three different test case design techniques which are as follows:
Error Guessing
Equivalence Partitioning
Boundary Value Analysis[BVA]

The main purpose of this technique is to identify common errors at any level of testing by exercising the following tasks:

Enter blank space into the text fields.
Null pointer exception.
Enter invalid parameters.
Divide by zero.
Use maximum limit of files to be uploaded.
Check buttons without entering values.
The increment of test cases depends upon the ability and experience of the tester.
