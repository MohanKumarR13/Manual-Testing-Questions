What is Test Scenarios?
-----------------------
It is a breakup of a business requirement presented from of possible use cases with the help of
scenarios can provide more test coverage for the functionalities of the application
In simple words it is a functionality to be tested

Examples
--------
1.Check if the user is able to send multimedia files while chatting
2.Check if the user is able to make an audio call
3.Check if the user is able to put status
4.Check if the users is NOT able to send files more than 300 MB through attachments

These scenarios can be further split into test cases which contains steps on how to perform the tests

Drawback if you are writting only scenarios
-------------------------------------------
Imagine the feature files that we have writtern while learning Cucumber Lets say if we eliminate the given 
When the statements from the scenario we will be having only the name of the scenario and if someone is new
to the system uner test he or she will not be aware of the steps to be followed with just the name of the 
scenario in that case test cas will be most helpful
