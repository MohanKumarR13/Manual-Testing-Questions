What is seviority ?
-------------------
It is a measure to indicate the impact of a bug/defect can have on the software product

Based on the threat it cause to the product,seviority is categorized into below
1.Low 2.Minor 3.Major 4.Crictical

What is Priority ?
------------------
Bug Priority refers to how urgently a bug needs to be fixed

Level of Bug priority
---------------------
Low: The bug can be solved later. Other, more detrimental bugs take precedence.
Medium: A bug that can be rectified during standard development and testing.
High: The bug must be fixed as soon as possible because it has a negative impact on the application and makes it useless until it is solved.

In most cases priority and seviority is proportional

1. High Severity and Low Priority Example
-------------------------------------------
In legacy browsers, your website’s home page renders poorly. The logo doesn’t load, or the text overlaps. 
The functionality and user experience of the product are being hampered.

Hence the severity of the bug is high. Although it will only bring in a few visits because we’re talking about the old browser, 
it could be regarded as a low priority.

2. High Severity and High Priority Example
---------------------------------------------
As a website tester for a SaaS company, let’s say you test your website on Chrome and have no problems with how it looks or feels. 
However, the text and frames on the pricing page appear distorted if you switch from Google Chrome to Internet Explorer.

Both the buttons for purchasing the plans and the pricing you were provided based on the features included in a plan have vanished. 
Consumers might not comprehend what they are getting for what price. In addition, the buttons are missing, so even if they wanted to buy them, they couldn’t.

High Severity because the buyer is not shown the pricing grid, resulting in a barrier to purchasing the product.

High Priority because the problem must be fixed right away because it prevents the sale of the product.

3. Low Severity and High Priority Example
---------------------------------------------
You’re attempting to test the website’s functionality. When the website is invoked in the most recent version of Google Chrome, 
the buttons can be seen to overlap slightly. Even if they can still be clicked on separately, the visual representation is becoming unsteady.

There are a few minor alignment concerns on the website. Even though it doesn’t look good, the user can still enjoy browsing the internet.

4. Low Severity and Low Priority Example
-------------------------------------------
You may have discovered a typo while checking a website’s privacy statement or disclaimer, or you may have discovered that the font and colour scheme 
needs to match the overall design of your website. 

Although it doesn’t affect your web app’s functioning and also because most users wouldn’t see it, it is not as it should be. 
Hence it is a bug. Maintaining a low severity and low priority would be acceptable since it doesn’t have to be fixed immediately.
