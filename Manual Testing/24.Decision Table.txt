Decision table technique is one of the widely used case design techniques for black box testing. This is a systematic approach where various input combinations and their respective system behavior are captured in a tabular form.

That's why it is also known as a cause-effect table. This technique is used to pick the test cases in a systematic manner; it saves the testing time and gives good coverage to the testing area of the software application.

Decision table technique is appropriate for the functions that have a logical relationship between two and more than two inputs.

This technique is related to the correct combination of inputs and determines the result of various combinations of input. To design the test cases by decision table technique, we need to consider conditions as input and actions as output.
