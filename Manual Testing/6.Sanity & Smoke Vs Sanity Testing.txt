Sanity Testing
--------------
Sane x Insane
Insane= Mad,Not Being Rational or Unacceptable for common sense
Sane= Common Sense,Rational

Why Is Sanity Testing ?
------------------------
Performed After a new build is received
This new Build could be a resultant of inclusion of new functionality or due to bug fix

Difference Between Smoke And Sanity Testing
--------------------------------------------
Smoke Testing
=============
1.To Test Crictical Functionalities are working fine and assure the Stability
  of the build.
2.Done by testers
3.The Crictical Subset of test case would have already be written and maintained in an test management tool like (ALM or qTest),
  Hence it is a well documented process
4.The Testing team is deciding whether to accept or reject this build,so it can be a subset of Acceptance Testing
5.Crucial Scenario's of the entire system will be tested

Sanity Testing
==============
1.To Check the new functionality is working fine or the bugs have been fixed and is working fine and assure the rationality.
2.Done By testers
3.It is Undocumented as per conventional methodologies,But today mos companies recommened the best practice
  of writting a test case for any bug introduced.so it is kind of documented in some way.
4.Since we are doing this test after a code change or bug fix this can be subset of regression testing
5.Particular Component of the entire system will be tested
