State Transition Technique
---------------------------------
The general meaning of state transition is, different forms of the same situation, and according to the meaning, 
the state transition method does the same. It is used to capture the behavior of the software application when different 
input values are given to the same function.

We all use the ATMs, when we withdraw money from it, it displays account details at last. Now we again do another transaction, 
then it again displays account details, but the details displayed after the second transaction are different from the first transaction, 
but both details are displayed by using the same function of the ATM. So the same function was used here but each time the output was different, 
this is called state transition. In the case of testing of a software application, this method tests whether the function is following state transition s
pecifications on entering different inputs.
