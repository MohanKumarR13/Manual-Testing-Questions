Use Case Technique
-----------------------
The use case is functional testing of the black box testing used to identify the test cases from the beginning 
to the end of the system as per the usage of the system. By using this technique, the test team creates a test 
scenario that can exercise the entire software based on the functionality of each function from start to end.

It is a graphic demonstration of business needs, which describe how the end-user will cooperate with the software 
or the application.
