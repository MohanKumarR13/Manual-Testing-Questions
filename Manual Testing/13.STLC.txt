STLC->Software Test Life Cycle
-------------------------------
Requirement Analysis
Test Plan
Test Case Development
Test Environment setup
Test Excecution
Test Cycle Closure

Requirement Analysis
=====================
What will happen in this phase ?
1.Testing team studies the functional and non functional requirements from testing point of view
2.Automation feasibility for the testing project is also done in this stage
3.Find out what types of tests to be done
4.Create Requirement Traceability Matrix.

Test Plan
=========
A test plan is a detailed document that details the test strategy,onjectives,schedule,estimation,deadlines and the
resources required for completing that particular project

It is a blueprint for running the tests needed to ensure the software is working properly maintained by test Architects or test manager
Note: test Planning to be covered as a separate 

Test Case Development
======================
Once the test plan is ready the test data is collected for the testing and then the test
cases are written and reviewed
Note: test Planning to be covered as a separate

Test Environment setup
=====================
Mostly this will done by operations team or sometimes,Dev team
When the environment is setup smoke test is performed

Test Excecution
===============
This is the regular part of work for the testers
Excecuting the test cases finding the bugs,tracking the bugs to closure,retesting,mapping defects to test cases in RTM are activiities comes under this phase

Test Cycle Closure
==================
Test Completion,collection of test results and report metrics
analyse the artifacts obtained in this cycle and plan for effective future testing
